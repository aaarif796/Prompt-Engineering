      "In India, the concept of alimony is primarily governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Divorce Act, 1869, among other laws. While it is more common for wives to receive alimony from husbands, there are instances where husbands can also claim alimony from their wives. Here are three notable statements or principles from Indian courts regarding husbands receiving alimony:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Equality and Gender Neutrality**: The Supreme Court of India has emphasized that the law should be gender-neutral when it comes to alimony. In the case of *Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997)*, the court highlighted the need for equality in legal provisions, stating that both spouses have the right to seek maintenance based on their financial needs and the other spouse's ability to pay. This principle has been applied in cases where husbands have successfully claimed alimony from their wives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Financial Dependency**: In the case of *Rajnesh v. Neha (2021)*, the Supreme Court ruled that the financial status of both parties should be considered when determining alimony. If a husband can demonstrate that he is financially dependent on his wife or that he has a lower income, he may be entitled to receive alimony. The court recognized that the traditional roles of men and women are evolving, and financial dependency can exist in various forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Standard of Living and Contribution**: In the case of *K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017)*, the court acknowledged that the standard of living during the marriage and the contributions made by both spouses should be taken into account when deciding on alimony. If a husband can prove that he contributed significantly to the household or that the wife has a higher income, he may be awarded alimony to maintain a similar standard of living post-divorce.\n",
      "\n",
      "These principles reflect the evolving nature of alimony laws in India, recognizing that both men and women can be entitled to financial support after a divorce based on their circumstances.\n"
